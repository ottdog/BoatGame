# Issues with other long term RTS games (such as Grepolis, Starborne: Sovergn Space, etc)
## Pay for Advantage
This is the elephant in the room, so I might as well address this first. In my personal opinion, the profit motive has been sucking the fun out of modern gaming. Publishers have the incentive to exploit human psychology to extract as much profit out of their players using a litany of premium currencies, limited edition premium items, and "convienences". 

The long term MMORTS genre has been hit harder than others. While popular genreas like first person shooters or MMORPG's have many ways to monetize without affecting competitive gameplay (experience boosters, cosmetics, and the like), the MMORTS genere is too niche to have the capital to justify selling things like unit reskins. It is also too niche to attract a sizable player base with a traditional one time payment or subscription model. This leaves gameplay advantages as a the main monetization route.

Existing MMORTS games will sell items as convienences and justify it as not pay to win because it *** NEED TO FINISH ***


## Snowballing
## Resolves Into Raw Number Game
## Full Sandbox
The existing MMORTS games have gone full sandbox with regards to alliance formation. Letting players choose their own groups doesn't often lead to balanced teams. ***NEED TO FINISH***

## Not Good for a Small Number of Players
In terms of content, the "meat" of the experience of existing MMORTS depends on having other players to coordinate with and compete against.  ***NEED TO FINISH***

# Design Axioms
## No pay for advantage
Players cannot be able to puchase an advantage over other players.

## Ability to come back
A losing team must be able to come back from a loss *in a way that's satsifying for all players*. This means not only should desing measures be taken to avoid snowballing, but the measures to avoid it can't be something like Mario Kart's blue shell where the losing team is just straight up given an advantage the winning team has no counterplay against. It should be more like a match of soccer, where a team winning after the first half of a match has no effect on the second half. 

## Multiple factors at play
Instead of the outcome of the battle coming down to the quantity of units and maybe an RNG element, I would like multiple other factors to be at play in a battle. At this stage I plan on positioning, equipment, and rules of engagement weigh in on the battle.

## Life freindly
