## What is Boat Game?

Boat Game is a browser based multiplayer strategy game based around WWII warship technology. 

Put on your admiral hat and command your fleet of ships to compete against the computer or other players as you help one of
two fictional alliances win their war for global domination. 

As an Admiral, you'll be able to design and customize your own boats and submit orders to your higher ups for them. Unlike
other strategy games, you aren't in charge of tedious resource management. You just put in requests for boats, put your
boats into taskforces,
