# Issues with other long term RTS games (such as Grepolis, Starborne: Sovergn Space, etc)
## Pay for Advantage
This is the elephant in the room, so I might as well address this first. In my personal opinion, the profit motive has been sucking the fun out of modern gaming. Publishers have the incentive to exploit human psychology to extract as much profit out of their players using a litany of premium currencies, limited edition premium items, and "convienences". 

The long term MMORTS genre has been hit harder than others. While popular genreas like first person shooters or MMORPG's have many ways to monetize without affecting competitive gameplay (experience boosters, cosmetics, and the like), the MMORTS genere is too niche to have the capital to justify selling things like unit reskins. It is also too niche to attract a sizable player base with a traditional one time payment or subscription model. This leaves gameplay advantages as a the main monetization route.

Existing MMORTS games will sell items as convienences and justify it as 'not pay to win' because it's something a dedicated player can do on their own. ***NEED TO FINISH***

## Snowballing
The way most existing MMORTS games function creates a snowball effect. Players who start early have more time to get resources. players who start building first have more units in the first battles, players with more units win the first battles, usually losing fewer resources worth of units. Players that upgrade resource buildings first get more time with the production bonus, so more bonus resources. Players who come in later or lose a few key battles in the beggining are just left at a disadvantage, even with perfecct play. Which players/alliances are relevant is ususally decided within a week or two.

## Unhealthy expected time investment
Existing MMORTS games also use mechanics that encourage players to log in as often as possible and stay logged in as long as possible. 

As an example of one such mechanic, it is genre conventions to give a player warning when there is an incoming attack. When player cities/bases are at stake, the incentive is to notice the attack as soon as possible to avoid losing your base. Because reinforicng units from allies travel in real time, noticing an attack sooner effectively increases the radius that players can call for help from. This mechanic alone becomes the source of stressful mind games, with many player made guides not just instrucing players to learn the log in patterns of their enemies to know the best time to attack, but also instucting them to occasionally log in and do tasks at times that are inconvienent for them to make it harder for other players to figure out your login schedule.

Other mechanics that force players to stay logged on include Grepolis' village tribute mechanics (where you get more total resources if you demand tribute every five minutes than if you were to do so less frequently) and Starborne's solar flare mechanic (limited time resource drop on the map that players that notice sooner can take from multiple times or take from flares further away). These mechanics also contribute to the resource snowballing.

While not an explicit mechanic, the goals of alliances in these games require coordination which also leads to alliance cultures that pressure players to be as available as possible, preferably keeping the game always running if possible.

## Resolves Into Raw Number Game
The algorithms to determine the outcome of battles in games like Starborne or Grepolis usually come down to how many units the two players have and maybe some RNG. Grepolis might use an abstraction like three damage types that units could inflict or Starborne might let you choose one of three possible fleet formations, but ultamately these end up resolving to one extra layer of RNG via a match of rock, paper, scissors. All the server cares about in the end is how many of what units are there.

## Full Sandbox
The existing MMORTS games have gone full sandbox with regards to alliance formation. Letting players choose their own groups doesn't often lead to balanced teams. In addition, they rely heavily on the players to make all of the interesting engagments themselves. While I think player driven content is cool, there needs to be *some* objective for 'lone wolf' players or something for teams to work towrds off peak hours. A game that requires other players dies when there are fewer players playing than it was designed for.

## Not Good for a Small Number of Players
In terms of content, the "meat" of the experience of existing MMORTS depends on having other players to coordinate with and compete against. This is somthing I like about them. But with that said, that's the only content really abailable in existing MMORTS games. Existing games are designed arould alliances of dozens (or in extreme cases, hundreds) of players. There are solo MMORPG players and MMORPG players that prefer playing in a small group of known friends. MMORPG's usually do a good job of catering to those players too. Why can't the MMORTS genre?

# Design Wishlist
## No pay for advantage
Players cannot be able to puchase an advantage over other players.

## Ability to come back
A losing team must be able to come back from a loss *in a way that's satsifying for all players*. This means not only should desing measures be taken to avoid snowballing, but the measures to avoid it can't be something like Mario Kart's blue shell where the losing team is just straight up given an advantage the winning team has no counterplay against. It should be more like a match of soccer, where a team winning after the first half of a match has no effect on the second half. 

## Multiple factors at play
Instead of the outcome of the battle coming down to the quantity of units and maybe an RNG element, I would like multiple other factors to be at play in a battle. At this stage I plan on positioning, equipment, and rules of engagement weigh in on the battle.

## Life freindly
Games are supposed to be fun. Even thouogh a game is supposed to take place over weeks, the game shouldn't get in the way of work, academics, or sleep.
