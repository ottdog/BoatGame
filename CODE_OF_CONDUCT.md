## Preamble

This is a community for a video game about boats. Please for the love of whatever higher power/values you believe in, understand this 
is just an entertainment product. 

Now, I have no clue how large this community will grow. As the community grows, I'll likely add more concrete rules. But for now,
I think we'll fare well with just two rules.

## Rules

1. Don't be an asshole.
2. Don't do things that are illegal, violate GitHub ToS, or otherwise break rules set by people with more authority than me,
regardless of your ability to make a philosophical case that it isn't an assholey thing to do.

## Enforcement

As of writing this, I, Ottdog, am the only person that can moderate things in this community. As of Writing this, I'm also the only
person in this community. As the community grows, I'll appoint moderadors as nessisary, but for now understand I am just one person
that isn't always online. Because of this, there might be a delay of hours or days between rule breaking behavior and remediation.

Punsihments will be by Ottdog's discretion. They will range from a warning for minor assholery to permanent bans from the comunity
for severe assholery. 

Report rule breaking behavior to @Ottdog#1688 on discord (preffered method) or ottod66@gmail.com (slower method, please start the
subject line with "Boat Game").
